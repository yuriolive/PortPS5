// will write are noted, so a CPU access to such a range (the GuestMemory flush hook) syncs first.
// Every call happens under GuestMemory::GpuMutex, except WaitSerial and the static lock-free readers

// signals a timeline semaphore with its serial: a thread can then wait for "everything submitted
// up to serial S" WITHOUT the mutex (WaitSerial), because the monotonic value cannot be reset or
// recycled the way the pooled batch fences are, and afterwards run the completions under the mutex
// (FinishUpTo). Without timeline semaphores callers use the locked Sync as before.

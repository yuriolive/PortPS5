# Coding Conventions

### C++ Naming Conventions

- Interface names (classes containing only pure virtual methods with no implementation) start with `I`, as in C#.
- Class names and public method names use PascalCase.
- Private method and field names use camelCase.
- Function argument names use camelCase.
- Template parameter names follow the C# style: `TKey`, `TValue`, `TIterator`.

Comments in code can only be added to indicate areas of [technical debt](TechnicalDebt.md) (only by a human), the end of `#endif`, and the end of namespace.
